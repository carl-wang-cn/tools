I will add some little scripts which improve my work efficience here.
Hopefully the scripts also can help more friends

1. simple\_httpserver.py, this is a little http server which depends on web.py (google it and get it installed first)
2. http\_method.py, you can use this script to send GET/POST/HEAD request, and it can set http body, cookie, and it supports https/http connections.
   besides, you can get the response printed out. configurations should be set in the code as now.
